# Number-Guesser2

## Project goals
- This application is designed to generate a random number on page load. From there, there are two imputs for users to try and guess the number. Upon successful guess a card will append, populated with the users names and the winner name. A few other pieces of information are attached to the card. That includes the total number of guesses until successful win and the duration of time until that win. All the cards can be removed from the DOM with their respective delete buttons or the clear all button. 

## Learning goals
- The learning goals for this project were to develop skills in writing semantic, dry HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The focus of my group was to utalize arguments and parameters to make JavaScript more clean and dynamic.
